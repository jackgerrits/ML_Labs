-1 |text subject california update the following report contains confidential and sensitive information please treat with discretion executive summary ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives politically bush determined let the crisis blame fall davis from economic perspective unwilling create disincentives for new power generation davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan most notably its exclusion out state generators june lst kill clause for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summer economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement bid for advance payments from likely fail bankruptcy court new generation delays probable because state squabbling consumer groups are preparing constitutional challenge socal bailout deal ferc fallout the ferc decision holding move the bush administration that looks like action but not rather allows the situation california continue develop virtually unabated the political strategy appears allow the situation deteriorate the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame once they are politically inoculated the administration can begin look regional solutions moreover the administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate the forthcoming cheney commission report its opposition stronger price caps the grounds that they are unwilling create disincentives the construction new generation interesting and ironic note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan something less than effective price caps from davis point view the ferc plan has four major flaws the order applies only california not the rest the west non california generators are not required sell capped rates california the order written more price floor for emergency power than ceiling state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks after stage emergency and does not require any collusion even when the price caps kick they are based the cost plus for the highest cost producer supplying power california and not require wholesalers abide the cap the generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge ferc proposal kill clause adds the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes kill clause that says the caps will withdrawn unless california iso agrees june lst become part the regional grid now under ferc control davis doesn sign the regional grid june lst then will have live with june headlines blaming him for letting the bush price caps plan collapse growing fiscal risk california sources speculate that california could therefore pay much billion power this summer this more than the combined enterprise value and sce these sources believe that because the severity the situation the ferc and the federal government will forced take further action control prices for power the consensus that the state california will run out money about days one the first projects cancelled will state plans finance new power plant construction exchange for long term power deals the bleak fiscal picture also causing bank creditors revisit the bridge loans they are providing california the bush administration and the fed are only now waking the seriousness the fiscal picture the country largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits matter months qfs seek advance payment from meanwhile the bankruptcy front the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today give them advance payment from pge accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas appears very unlikely that the qfs request will granted the qfs not receive advance payment likely that most the 000 gas fired capacity will remain offline delays likely new generation the deals made with the state for long term contracts are being continually renegotiated which likely mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed finance will not online early anticipated consumer groups ready challenge constitutionality sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing analysis the mou for the sce bailout plan the analysis was done utilities analyst rather than lawyer though appears raise number good legal points for example one the elements the mou non bypassable charge ratepayers that would require them pay even they disconnect from the grid this effectively tax since there exchange value for money which under the constitution cannot used directly benefit private entity this makes the bonds that would issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds according the constitution the state cannot put into debt benefit private company for this and other reasons even the republicans would vote for the sce bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand likely constitutional challenge governor hurt continued failure disclose long term power contracts the issue the governor failure disclose the details the long term power contracts continues distress the other players the crisis even were disclose everything and his staff have been negotiating likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged

-1 |text subject california update executive summary comprehensive deal reached april chances bankruptcy increase due one day opt out clause all long term power contracts and state locked tough negotiations several issues the table puc imposed requirement forcing state times book value times book value will not use any the secured last week help their ailing utility davis announcement long term power contract didn include some details the 800 megawatts secured this far only 000 are available this summer some the long term contracts are really only for three months none the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand the spot market one the same day davis announced long term contracts davis also quietly announce rate hike ferc may the wild card approving this deal transmissions deal one thing that still uncertain bankruptcy may still likely alternative current negotiations buy share the electric transmission grid fail produce deal april when all long term power contracts being negotiated have one day opt out clause they can exercise unilaterally comprehensive solution has not been reached the state and its major utilities according sources close senior officials made clear that any hope for politically acceptable deal the transmission lines depends the california government willingness make major financial commitment has been completely unwilling make until now will not make final deal sell its grid unless davis agrees relieve the puc imposed requirement the electricity buyer last resort current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating purchasing enough electricity all times supply california energy needs long the state steps and makes those purchases has for the past three months the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated paying premiums for spot market power and selling consumers who are shielded low rate ceilings but officials are worried this summer supply and davis concern over how fast draining the state budget surplus things get into crunch this summer and davis makes new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity buys through long term contracts then will left holding the bag thus part the negotiations over buying the electricity grid demanding comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed pay state officials are mood grant that kind get out jail free card the two sides remain locked extremely tough negotiations that are complicated three other factors state legislative demands that the price davis negotiate for and the ferc must positively approve any grid purchase the state california the principal concern the price front that wants sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value their transmission while consumer groups insist that two times book value the politically acceptable limit see times book value absolute upper bound there way will get more than that whatever they think according the leader one main consumer groups are going try force any deals down about any case negotiators for davis are also trying proposition proof any transmission deal protect against later ballot proposal they think there are ways that but not the price part the grid triggers ballot initiative remember davis eventual solution triggers ballot initiative will running for election the same ballot public initiative designed overturn his solution the sacramento front one understands motives the one question one sacramento can figure out what kind game playing three day period made series announcements that left everyone scratching their heads late thursday officials leaked information california papers that they had agreed principle sell their part the electricity transmission grid the state which seemed like obvious good news but then made clear discussions that the price they were asking was least above what the state was currently offering while deal can still done anything like the billion wants would very hard get through the california legislature which needs approve any purchase late friday officials announced that they had secured billion loan for the parent company not the electricity utility and would use the money pay off bondholders other creditors and return 161 million shareholders new dividend payout not cent that money was earmarked help the struggling electricity orphan and that left least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood over the weekend leaked story claiming that was willing pay off its energy suppliers debt for cents the dollar right now for generators who are having make decisions each morning about whether start legal actions that protect their rights any eventual bankruptcy action hold off the assumption that the politics this process will make them whole couple months that kind trial balloon extremely unnerving thus very short time period corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling use these funds smooth the way toward solution the energy crisis davis has demanded that all the major utilities absorb least part the billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and fund raising will harden and deepen those demands one senior political official told our source just when you think the corporate leadership that company has insulted completely possible they come with something even more outrageous and some these long term contracts are actually only good for three months none these contracts however keep california from having buy the most expensive peak demand electricity the spot market davis agrees new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year while the media was concern with davis announcement long term contracts for california less concern the media was davis quietly announced decision let rates rise again for electricity consumers the state will accept the emergency surcharge levied consumers january permanent increase well additional increase for consumers that will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires that would bring the average charge about cents kilowatt hour ferc the other major danger the transmission line deal that the federal energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply failing approve positive vote senior california officials and legislators doubt that ferc has jurisdiction and believe that ferc would not dare stop deal but they may wrong the deal can only through ferc specifically signs off the deal its power over transmission deal absolute matter what anyone says according source close the president there are three possibilities ferc could pocket veto not even putting agenda for discussion the deal put the agenda but gets voted down the democrat the commission william massey has already said opposed the commission could approve but with condition that davis has agree bring the lines into regional grid system one complicating factor the ferc decision however that its chairman curt hebert who adamantly opposed the transmission line sale may not around long enough have his say hebert definitely not shoo for the ferc chairman position says

absolutely crucial companies are clearly coming crossroads their storage implementations with estimates for internet storage capacity needs doubling every three months professionals are hungry for

organizations rely distributed storage model that uses file servers process requests from end users and other application servers this model all requests for data through the file server that owns the attached storage disks and only one file server can tap data particular disk via scsi bus this model has several shortcomings first the amount data server can access restricted the number disks supported the bus which limits the capacity single file server second because the server processes each request risks becoming bottleneck third this server model carries some daunting availability limitations because only one file server allowed access set disks that file server any its scsi connections fails then users and other application servers lose access the stored files this model carries other major disadvantages distributed file servers rely the data transport network run backup and recovery operations which can eat bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions crawl

-1 |text subject summary rto week day planning expansion fyi and claudette please forward your groups thanks original message from walton steve sent wednesday october 2001 rto week day october 2001 transmission planning expansion the afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion the panelists were jose degado ceo american transmission company michael dworkin chair vermont psc mark maher transmission business line bonneville power administration lara manz pse masheed rosenqvist national grid steve walton enron general observations the commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time time commissioner breathitt and massey were the most active questioning the ferc staff were active asking questions after the initial presentations moving along the discussion asking questions there was some reference the morning discussion congestion management however there was discussion the merits the various types transmission rights there was good deal consensus around the concept the rto planning process being first provider information the market where are problems how might they solved etc and that the where possible that expansion funded market participants who would benefit there was good deal discussion least cost planning and the identification options which are not transmission related all agreed there had backstop authority build transmission however then the challenge who pays for which raises the need for dispute resolution opening statements jose delgado atc transmission only company with miso the system operator they view everyone customer whose needs are met they were formed divestiture ious coops and munis and with 500 million asset base initially their current ten year plan will add billion investment their top priorities are connecting generation and load michael dworkin because transmission common good construction affects all parties not just one party the environmental and permitting lines requires balance benefits with costs and long range view the idea joint boards should considered for dealing with multi state projects although ferc has show little interest joint boards they have been used fcc state input needed because the local needs and impacts which must considered mark maher ferc must consider the unique characteristics the west when considering congestion management lmp not good fit hydro systems with their multiple use obligations rto west developing planning process which will give the rto the freedom develop options learn the future the rto needs strong centralized planning process laura manz the various aspects planning are connected pricing lmp the key getting the right signals for expansion transmission and resources competitor should have advantage over another the rto needs central planning process but shouldn push solutions the market should decide solutions masheed rosenqvist the morning discussion congestion management talked about hedging against risk the planning discussion not about what have now but about how avoid future congestion the commission has taken conflicting positions different cases the issues that need answered are how can merchant transmission compensated should transmission projects open rfps ferc open market based pricing for expansions steve walton the most important thing for ferc for expansion settle the matter industry structure away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment the rto debate has been going for years more and needs settled for expansion forward there needs clear property right which accrues the expanding party you are always going have muddy issues planning for instance 138 line all that needed day but future considerations scare right way say 345 line should built who pays for the extra cost order resolve such matters the planning process must include dispute resolution process appeal able ferc decide such matters discussion kevin kelly asked about fact that some parties benefit form current congestion how does stakeholder process get things built when some oppose most agreed that party wants fund construction should built with the beneficiaries funding michael dworkin expressed concerns about use eminent domain build which means benefit test must exist say this the best solution least cost planning this lead discussion the need for the rto provider information all parties they can make intelligent decisions commissioner massey asked about whether the system was under built and needed lots expansion don worry about overbuilding transmission planning should consider all options before construction new facilities the panel agreed that pricing needs prime determinant the process michaela dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions laura manz felt that the term under built secondary effect not having proper pricing locational prices guide parties dick neil asked lmp will work the west mark maher said wouldn laura manz said applies everywhere because physics they manage hydro facilities pjm michael dworkin said lmp means explicit measure cost congestion and the value generation locations and ought not rejected just intelligently designed bpa looking pricing model but lmp won work steve walton said lmp needed for real time dispatch but given the nature the northwest hydro system must have some tweaks like bilaterals and allow operator self schedule output levels permit river coordination hydro system optimizes over weeks and months maximize firm energy production not hour hour basis pjm has hydro but not the northwest implementation will different because such thing unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal the summation the end the panel four principles were listed rto must provide information rto should identify solutions rto should unbiased and the rto should accountable the disagreement was over the last two points michael dworkin felt that unbiased was critical and that accountability was accomplished having regulators involved governance jose delgado said and transco can unbiased since provides services although the iso above can

-1 |text subject california update executive summary davis struggles find senate support for socal transmission deal only chance deal going through one time quick vote deal has hearings will probably die not transmission deal legislators will seize assets and seek price caps asset seizure would target power contracts then power plants result the endless court battles will ensue but this gives davis opportunity continue blame generators and marketers bankruptcy for socal still the most likely scenario with the qfs socal itself likely file the transmission deal dies gets amended congressional democrats rally around davis and seize opportunity blame the administration transmission deal and democratic support governor gray davis scrambles build support for his socal transmission proposal one thing evident the longer the deal exposed public debate the less likely pass fact politicians have been leery the deal that davis has been unable locate even one sponsor introduce the bill the senate the eyes many democratic legislators and all republicans forcing socal edison into bankruptcy looking like better option than buying the transmission lines that why the governor senior strategists have quietly been trying schedule quick down vote the transmission line purchase early next week the bill currently not scheduled voted effort avoid debate however there opening within the next two weeks and davis feels has enough support will pushed through because the socal deal needs every piece place negotiated davis team the team wants amendments allowed the assembly floor and quick vote this unlikely fast track strategy fails for davis the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily keep mind that that cannot even resubmitted the assembly until has been vetted socal edison attorneys according sources the legislature going try modify the memorandum understanding between gov davis and sce however the senate leadership does not believe there will sufficient support pass even modified mou burton reportedly believes that least democrats will vote against along with the republicans the more that bill gets picked apart public the uglier looks and the more democrats will realize that they are all alone supporting another problem faced the legislatures the deal favor socal and not the state among other things the state overpaying about billion for the transmission lines additionally the mou davis has with socal nearly matches point for point the deal davis condemned with asset seizures since before the bankruptcy filing have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become major pursuit for increasingly frustrated democrats davis legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law eminent domain seizures everything from power generating assets across california existing power contracts negotiated whom davis calls profiteering power brokers course everyone the governor office understands that any seizing would immediately end state and federal courts and would legal nightmare there are few minor constitutional legal and interstate commerce problems the main thing that the seizing would continue davis main approach this problem management press conference and would put the governor and democrats the right side the issue punishing the capitalist leeches according one senior democratic legislator there movement within democratic members the state assembly demand that davis agree seize the power contracts return for their vote favor the power transmission purchase course taking the contracts would only setting precedent for taking the power plants the appeal seizing the contracts that would allegedly put california state officials charge where the power sold and reduce mark ups substantially they used the contract power authority provide spot market power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the price through the roof price caps one strong indication whether not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully decisions made the three republican governors from colorado alaska and wyoming these three were the key players during the portland western governor conference last january and according senior white house officials took the personal and prolonged intervention president bush himself peel these three away from otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors they had signed that price cap appeal the administration source said would already have price caps they start make clear something has changed will have listen sources indicate that these republican leaders begin rethink their opposition price caps the bush administration will forced reconsider price caps remedy for the west cost plus caps think these republican price caps that their first duty make sure private companies make money and have incentives provide power into the affected grid just give some idea magnitudes cost plus deal current discussions would put cap power costs something like 250 per kilowatt hour that long way down from the august futures contract that pricing 750 per kilowatt hour but long way above last august 150 kwhr price and particularly long way above the cost generating this power which something like kwh market price exceptions the option allows the bush administration have political credit for imposing price caps write ferc currently the process considering permit renewals for five companies generating power california duke dynegy aes reliant and williams the permit grants further three year waiver that allows them sell power into california the existing whatever price the market will bear other words ferc could simply not grant these companies the right sell energy the market price perhaps changing definition controlling market share and then power control prices would revert back ferc technically granting the extension these permits ferc has establish formal finding that the five power companies not wield market power that means they cannot affect the price energy withholding power crucial times course ferc has just found three different rulings the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates adjust for the subsequent price spikes but that would mean ferc would have want wield effective power over price capping california and they have shown desire that front the escape clause for ferc simply renew the waivers that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than electricity market and none these companies come close other words the waivers option lets ferc escape the bush administration and ferc commissioners really want escape once again that decision may more the hands the three republican governors than anywhere else the country but you can certain that the past few days administration officials have become fully aware the potential political liabilities doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants democrats seize opportunity blame bush senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come high billion which would destroy state finances for decade add that the constant drumbeat numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct out pocket electricity costs they paid billion for electricity 1999 billion 2000 and are expected pay billion this year ten times the rate two years ago then course they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home very direct way and well who can blame the democrats for saying there simple solution but the white house won allow national level democrats realize california power crisis prime opportunity chastise the bush administration and its free market advocate ferc chairman hebert over their resistance summer price caps california leaders calculate this year taxpayer energy bill potentially billion rogue gallery democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with governor davis and coordinating efforts fan out across the eight western states the power grid with singular message the solution all western voters electricity problems lies right washington ferc headquarters controlled bush administration appointees and the political dialogue takes more aggressive national tone and its possible impact control over the congress comes more into focus the solutions articulated california democrats who sense they have republicans the run the west become less and less free market focused the two strains the democratic solution that are becoming unavoidable part the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps

parties they did not have data what they are owed nor amount refunds due them contrary the judge claim number northwest utilities did submit claim amounts the settlement conference although the problem each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts wagner was probably frustrated that there was standard methodology for these calculations and appears leaning against giving utilities the same fast track status california ferc had originally not even wanted consider claims this conference until group senators got together and applied some pressure the result was there was not much time get the overcharge data together below another rough breakdown the claims pacificcorp million snohomish pud 229 million tacoma power million seattle city light 222 million port seattle

california state may challenged bankruptcy proceedings bankruptcy court were issue ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and potentially bankrupt socal possible that bpa could press refund request the range 100 however while bpa refund request may option stabilize their finances they are also careful about voicing their opinion because the 167 million gross sales they made from california bpa administration the bush administration reportedly has current plans replace the bpa administrator the entire northwest delegation democrats and republicans from the bpa region has asked

souter 2000 business insurance page copyright 2000 crain communications inc all rights reserved exchange based insurance products developed recent years have been somewhat slow get off the ground although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since the mid 1990 cover insurance risks none far has posted significant volume trades few insurers reinsurers policyholders have been drawn away from the traditional insurance markets where capacity remains abundant and relatively cheap long those traditional markets manage weather major natural catastrophes the allure the exchange based products will remain limited observers say also stifling the growth the exchange based contracts the limited number contracts available one expert noted dealers said are unable secure suitable hedge laying off one contract against another although the various exchanges have had good opportunity establish widely used set new risk financing products that has not been achieved said morton lane senior managing director capital markets division gerling global financial products new york the main problem with the existing exchanges that they not offer sufficiently diverse array products said the only way control the risks the catastrophe options have diversified portfolio other contracts and none the exchanges currently offers sufficiently broad range options provide for that hedge said florida windstorm options for example cannot bought and then hedged the same way that international business machines corp stock options contracts can hedged with ibm stock lane explained the exchanges might more attractive investors addition natural catastrophe options they included options other risks said those might include for example satellite aviation and crop indexes lane said for the insurance buyer such exchange instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle but long they are quantifiable and indexable they may represent good surrogate said the exchanges could also used create derivatives market for over the counter securitized deals there are regular issuers catastrophe bonds lane said the soft insurance market has also hindered the growth exchange based insurance products said sean mooney senior and chief economist guy carpenter the reinsurance brokerage unit marsh inc new york the traditional market has been competitive that people are not looking for other ways doing business said least concept the exchange based deals are generally similar the mortgage backed securities that have been huge success since they were introduced the 1970

the exchanges have not brought substantial new capacity the marketplace said guy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities exchange reinsurance products the bce did not take off however and was suspended last year after two years little activity the oldest the insurance related exchange based derivative products are the catastrophe options traded the chicago board trade which began trading the options 1996 initially there was substantial interest the options but the soft traditional market has hampered use the contracts hedge catastrophe exposures said carlton purty independent broker the cbot who trades options catastrophe option trades have been completed the cbot far this year said last year there was increased interest the contracts because hurricane floyd but few contracts were traded purty said think major major catastrophe will have happen before they really take off said the contracts offer real protection and options dealers are keen trade new niche but the conventional insurance and reinsurance markets are soft that few companies are turning alternative coverage options purty said the catastrophe risk exchange located princeton has radically changed its structure since was originally announced mid 1996 and well positioned expand said frank sweeney chief operating officer catex initially planned computer based facility for reinsurers that would enable them exchange catastrophe risks and build balanced portfolios but the time the exchange was operational november 1996 was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested catex wanted only buy and sell conventional reinsurance sweeney said although there was some interest risk swapping only handful risks were posted the system and none was traded sweeney said consequently catex has become chiefly cash for cover exchange said noting that the risks reinsured the exchange include property catastrophe coverage aviation and liability coverages catex also trades industry loss warranties where coverage triggered actual loss combined with industry loss over agreed threshold other adjustments the exchange included making accessible through the internet november 1998 and late last year catex offered users the ability set smaller networks allowing them form groups whose members business only with one another since its inception catex has completed about 450 trades totaling 400 million premium and more than billion limits said catex roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their captives sweeney said obviously have long way but are pretty satisfied with what have achieved far sweeney said the exchange sees increased activity after major losses cedents seek buy replacement coverage offset depletions their existing cover said for example sweeney said there was flurry activity after the european windstorms december last year last september the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field insurance related derivatives when began offering weather derivatives thus far 420 futures contracts have been traded said larry grannan senior director product marketing the cme such contracts are designed allow businesses hedge against weather related losses for example utility may sell less power mild winter and would able use the futures hedge resultant fall revenues the exchange first offered heat based indexes for atlanta chicago cincinnati and new york january added philadelphia dallas des moines las vegas tucson and portland and began offering contracts based cold weather currently most the trades are between securities dealers themselves but eventually the contracts will likely used more extensively utilities and insurers grannan said addition the futures contracts

-1 |text subject california update executive summary edison mou condemned this friday cpuc meeting the idle plan angelides hides state budget concerns house committee vote energy relief edison mou doubtful the unusually calm settling over the california legislature about socal edison potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders have reported that through all plans from there not solid plan save this company and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may come fruition over the last few days edison executives have begun pointing hard the cpuc meeting this friday make break event for the company the because after the meeting davis mou plan buy socal grid will have chance preventing potential bankruptcy this plan essentially dead although governor daivs has yet say this press releases the final nail will happen after the cpuc adjourns its friday meeting without voting several necessary mou provisions unless the cpuc makes last minute emergency amendment their agenda the deal will dead despite socal support for letting the deal stand past its deadline sources indicate that cpuc president loretta lynch holds reservations the mou and continues distance herself from davis attempting influence policy making edison executives have spent the last few investor phone conferences warning that june would see substantially increased risks for creditor induced bankruptcy the davis plan dies cpuc this interesting since one else seems have been focused the date until edison began mentioning late last week however there more less threat bankruptcy than there now will two weeks reported several times earlier most everyone had given the mou long before this friday cpuc meeting plan shows little progress meanwhile the unhurried pace toward plan that reported last friday has gained little progress legislators continue pin point plan that will secure election votes and the same time weigh the need for rate hikes for california corporate and home electricity users they hash out the state spending even more electricity purchases spite better than expected levels conservation the state electricity expenditures over the last month rose average day the recent rate increases mean more spending the state and that calls into question the reassuring angelides scenario for california budget prospects later this year the california budget crunch even more worrisome than idle plan increasing evidence that last month conference call with state treasurer angelides was little misleading during that conference call angelides claimed that state comptroller connell and many the financial committee had the numbers wrong angelides argued that already spent buy power since january was really the total amount authorized spending through late august fact said only that had been spent sources now indicate that angelides was technically correct you use spent mean only the amount money for which checks had been written this different than the amount money california had already promised energy suppliers who had already supplied energy the state fact when angelides was speaking the state had fact already promised pay for energy had already consumed the total committed has topped the time the state gets its power bonds auctioned august they will have already spent all and back dipping into the general fund the idea rans being auctioned before the power bonds get issued still option the general fund doesn make august the nearest answer both these cash flow deficits lies part the painful process that the legislature undertaking now another round huge electricity rate hikes securitize debt issuance then the hope that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wholesale rates down and the debts can repaid the only near term path bringing generating assets line immediately the 500 from plants which are off line because cash flow problems settling their needs wrapped settling the and edison trade creditor issues which makes the legislature leisurely approach the rate hike haircut situation all the more troublesome energy relief the house energy commerce committee scheduled vote 1647 the emergency electricity relief act tomorrow the bill which was twice postponed and does not include any provisions price caps but during the course the mark sources indicate that possible even likely that democrat could offer price cap amendment rep waxman offered price cap amendment earlier mark the bill the subcommittee level the waxman amendment was rejected along party lines all republicans and democrats voted nay sources inside joe barton office report that staff and members have been meeting work out compromise the price cap issue but nothing has been resolved this afternoon those discussions have been terminated favor open discourse the committee tomorrow since agreement was not reached compromise language not expected offered amendment tomorrow would not something that leaders the republican and democrat sides have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass sources indicate that the committee does expect waxman and possibly others offer price cap language but not expected pass

difficult the republicans were planning offer alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost power spent date out the general fund thereby decreasing the amount the bond issuance approximately billion however the reportedly now are not going offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend hold out for full disclosure the governor plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms all long term contracts has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan and authorizes the dwr sell billion bonds this bill passed the senate march but has stalled the assembly due lack republican support deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts however sources report this bill may amended include language relevant the bond sale senator bowen currently senator bowen language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which passed would likely cause socal bankruptcy according sources close the republicans the legislature republicans not believe there should bridge loan due money available the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only the bonds approximately billion should issued other republicans reportedly not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend bring this debate monday additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that bridge loan unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out the bridge loan key points the bridge financing initial loan amount 125 lenders morgan lehman brothers bear stearns 625 tax exempt portion the 125 expected tax exempt projected interest rate taxable rate tax exempt rate current projected blended maturity date august 2001 for more details please contact 713 853 9510 bill passed the senate yesterday but little can done this time the senate passed yesterday which authorizes billion create the california consumer power and conservation authority the billion authorized under not the same the billion that must authorized the legislature pay for power already purchased the additional amount bonds that must authorized pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not support these authorizations without the details the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans not know what the final bond amount that must issued and that taxpayers will have pay support further action can taken regarding the implementation until clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power also there staff defined purpose etc for the california public power and conservation authority however this can considered victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier the crisis socal edison and bankruptcy this point two events would likely trigger socal bankruptcy the first would legislative rejection the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval the mou august however some decision will likely made earlier according sources the state has yet sign the mou with socal though socal has signed the republicans are against the mou its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed pass the legislature indicates that will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy its creditor involuntary due the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which linked directly the bond issuance would effort senator bowen amend bridge loan stating that the dwr would received 100 its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount other words the state will get paid before the utilities this language included and passed the legislature appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal urging the legislature pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments

-1 |text subject california update below the transcript interview conducted yesterday with state treasurer phil angelides summary bond issuance with year term tax exempt and non exempt angelides favor wind fall profit tax opposed current discussion between davis and socal regards socal paying off the generators over years with year grace period what decisions rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds the big things need are that the puc must enter into agreement with dwr essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will available for purchasing power really their job define what each party needs pay for power need give assurance the investment community that whatever the overall rate the state will get enough pay its bonds however the utilities challenge the decision could stall the bond issuance what you think will the size the first bond issue based what currently possible and what the legislature has authorized around the puc has allowed sell north but anticipate that absorbable until the administration provides details for this office and the public what its costs buying power are and what needs terms funding what will drive that number not what the puc has said the issuance may well single issue series smaller ones done together each weeks apart what the total size the market for tax exempt bonds what normally bonds for various revenues general obligations 1997 the infrastructure rate reductions bonds was issuance and this was handled well this not exclusively market around 200 these bonds sold each year anticipate that the bonds will tax exempt and non exempt what the total electric supply contracts that are firm enough require funding have estimates the dwr buying power and let say power costs 100 and its portion rates this bond issuance covers the diff between 100 and the bond issuance way cover the gap however power prices not come down you cannot keep borrowing issue more than bonds have see the whole financial plan the implication that will not keep this plan secret what will the term mix the bond issues overall term expected the year range not know the mix you have the ability bridging tax anticipation notes anything like that take care the general fund the very purpose the bridge loan that are taking taxable and tax exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued order for issue bonds number steps have occur would hope that the puc and dwr what they have realistically june then the bond issuance would come semi all once other words either all once something like billion every three weeks are all the general funds assets cash are some the form less liquid receivable have lot liquidity real cash general fund have cash flow have the ability pooled money investment accounts that can out five years have plus that account what the minimum working capital required the general fund for day day operations depends and goes and down any given day are doing the order 500 there 100 budget between the general funds and special fund are you discussing the dwr contracting relation the required funding you have veto the deals struck this all the administration court what have asked for the information have asked for this today letter have move from working with banks public offering which means public disclosure the general fund has been making advances buy power but want get out that business and stop the plus drain general fund from arranging interim loan what the credit risk from industry other large users cherry picking self selecting there are limits the options out there ablx has limited the ability people opt out the system you allow them opt out what they have pay preserve the revenue stream the agreement between the dwr and the puc will say that through financing order will get you the revenue service the bonds even adjusts rates this will covenant that the money will made available initiative launched could create enough uncertainty have effect abix the bond issuance what about harvey proofing what the direct state participation the state role infrastructure and economic development bonds will issued name dwr only pay for power the state buying not repay utility deb don think the state will repay utility debt the state can buy power out chapter there will participation the state bank know harvey well and and agree number things for example cosponsoring the public power authority should not put the state the business refinancing utility debt don think most consumer groups realize that are selling bonds pay for power very much want and interest repay the general fund the same time that this office financing the purchase energy the fundamental problem the price are being charged the generators the ransom that being demanded the generators agree with harvey that this current time the generators are winning will have consider excess profits taxes the generators continue they have increased their prices tenfold the generators they bought set plants for since january the state has spent over the generators don take their foot off our throat they may leave option but take back plants under emergency power let them justify those rates what causes the problem the generators jacking prices the point where they will make something about what the measurable size premium that will have paid based the most current estimates bond issue size measurable the wrong choice words don know how many basis points more than will begin feel also not for that proposal allow the utilities pay off the generators over years with year grace period they should work that out themselves not the backs ratepayers the perspective here that they did very very well 1996 and they upstreamed billions

csmitnick earthlink enet enron enron com sent monday may 2001 crenshaw shirley vkamins enron com subject energy leader consulting generation evaluator ege shirley requested herein information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski the presentation the ege tool applications and the allegheny energy case study timed take hour the meeting most conveniently scheduled for tuesday may might request set for late afternoon other appointments are the next day and vince will recall was leader the energy consulting business phb hagler bailly and developer the ramp real time check and electric strategy tools presently ceo energy leader consulting elc background the power generation industry has become increasingly efficient recent years rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively utilities who still control most power plants endeavor adopt the entrants methods yet inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread utility inefficiency arises from adherence decades old habits and unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling many utilities notwithstanding the industry wide trend towards profit maximization cling ingrained routines inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies small scale utility may operate relatively small system fewer than dozen plants small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective its focus its regulated customers playing the wholesale market the margin for variety reasons utilities are reluctant cut back the starts their generating units let alone shut down any even temporarily seasonally economically inefficient units continue committed week after week and run the half load range ege objectives ege identifies and assesses generating units utility with questionable commitment routines taking into account transmission and reliability factors the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may exploited another industry participant industry participant can use ege basis for medium long term wholesale power transaction with utility price wholesale power more aggressively take market share from the utility compel changes unit commitment habits industry participant can use ege spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from merger acquisition iii power plant developer can use ege estimate the incremental value new plant will enjoy when the target utility unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized specific ege concepts ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing profit opportunities produces indicative statistics such the frequency distribution starts per week the frequency distribution starts day minute segment during the week the frequency distribution load level the frequency distribution hours operation per start average heat rate and approximate fully allocated cost the half load range average ramp rate from the half load range the frequency distribution unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours and forced off maintenance outage rate where indicated indicative statistics are generally aggregated month year some cases temperature range they can regional wholesale prices well ege establishes the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly recent years ege based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data ege now updated for the quarter 2000 through december 2000 ege lst quarter 2000 through march 2001 will available approximately june 2001 ege also compares and ranks generating units commitment and dispatch with that similar units operated the target utility well other regional generators some utilities operate group economically marginal units the half load level for lengthy time periods without apparent reliability basis splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units other ege supporting data planned maintenance schedule where indicated actual maximum generating capacity actual minimum generating capacity actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government reported values average heat rate the full load range and average heat rate the three quarter load range with respect generating units average heat rate the half load three quarter load and full load ranges can instructive rank these relative similar generating units within region can also interest identify significant seasonal variations average heat rates and maximum capacities and changes recent years these parameters the real world example allegheny energy allegheny energy can serve case study illustrate the application ege the quarter 2000 for instance one high cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning times and committed for the whole day all but two cases arguably there are power products that could substitute for this routine part least profit the seller the product and allegheny energy another high cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn nine times and committed for most the coming week another plant two high cost units were operated too often the expensive half load range some 550 hours and three quarter load range another 400 600 hours they were seldom called upon run higher levels again there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal allegheny energy offering energy leader consulting elc ege procedure not software package data base elc believes this format more effective arming clients with the information they need act upon profit opportunities elc transfers its knowledge about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods straight forward four step process enron would select one three target utilities elc would perform the ege procedure the target utilities employing this real world analysis pedagogic tool elc one day seminar with enron personnel would instruct how perform the procedure the future without the assistance elc optionally elc would provide ege supporting data quarterly enron the basic ege supporting data set national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program virtually all fossil fuel units parameters that are incorporated and the data set format will specified upon request custom modifications will considered steven mitnick chief
